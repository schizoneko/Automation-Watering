# Automatic Watering System
## Introduction
Our Automatic Watering System project aimed at providing a convenient solution for watering plants automatically. This project targeting people who are passionate about growing plants in small spaces such as balconies, porches or terraces, but don't have time or easy to forget watering their plants.
